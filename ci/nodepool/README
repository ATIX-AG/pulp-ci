General Nodepool configuration information can be found at http://docs.openstack.org/infra/nodepool/

For Pulp's usage of nodepool an assumption is made that nodepool has been installed with
a user named 'nodepool'. As pip install or source install does not create a systemctl
service to start/stop nodepool a service definition is in this directory 'nodepoold.service'

The nodepool config expects a 'scripts' directory containing the script used to
setup base image for use as nodes. The base script that pulp has been using is
contained here at prepare_node.sh

The nodepool.yaml is a sample and will require significant editing to fill in the
credentials & proper directories on any new nodepool server.
