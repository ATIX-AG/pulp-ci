      <p>Install Pulp 3 on a host with Ansible, and smash it.</p>
      <p>
        The installation procedure assumes that Pulp and Pulp Smash should be
        installed on localhost. As a result, actions like SSH configuration are
        skipped.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, the "test" consists of running a simple command to verify
        that Pulp Smash is correctly installed.
